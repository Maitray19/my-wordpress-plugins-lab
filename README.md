# 🛠️ WordPress Plugin Experiments

A collection of beginner-friendly custom plugins I built while learning WordPress development.

Each plugin is designed to explore a different core concept — like widgets, shortcodes, hooks, admin menus, and JavaScript interactions — but with a fun twist. 

These aren’t production-grade tools, but creative experiments to show my understanding and curiosity.

## 🔍 What's Inside
- **Mood of the Day Widget** – Shows a new emoji, mood, and quote daily.
- **Auto Copyright Shortcode** – Adds a shortcode to dynamically show the current year.
- **Fun Fact Scroll Pop-up** – Surprise pop-up with a random fact once the user scrolls.
- **Resume Download Tracker** – Tracks how many times your resume was downloaded.
- **404 Detective** – Logs URLs of broken pages visitors land on.

## 📦 How to Use
Each folder contains a standalone plugin:
1. Copy it into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate from the WordPress dashboard.
3. Follow the README inside each plugin for customization instructions.
